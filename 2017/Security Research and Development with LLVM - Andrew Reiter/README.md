This repo contains some materials related to a talk
on security r&d projects that in some way use LLVM 
for doing their work.


- projects.md is a list of such projects
- code is a set of very basic, example code to help those interested in getting up to speed with some basics of LLVM. Don't hate.
- slides is the slide deck

#### Again on the code
I must repeat myself: the provided code is only meant to be basic helpers for learning about LLVM
and is not meant to be some new awesome tool (sadly, no). There is a great deal of research in 
dynamic and program analysis that is being done and the goal of this code is to make it so you
can start to more easily read some of the code from those projects ... and then make sense of it.
This is to avoid getting lost in code versus meaning.

There are many possible projects, but if you are looking for some
ideas to get you going, here are some. Note, you may need to look
at the slide deck or the projects.md file for some idea of what is
being said.


- Revive foreign-inference project to newer LLVM. Add support for LibFuzzer

- Passes that look at slices or pruning or other for improvements in fuzzing

- Use SAW on open source projects to flesh out things

- Create a tool that analyzes code meant to use Divine or Seahorn for the
purposes of cataloging or policy validation

- Build on Comminute to just be more realistic of a tool

- Build on IntFlip

- Build on npassert to determine asymptotic behaviors of code (think ASAP
from EPFL)

- Snapshotting kernel regions for replay

There are more, will add as i recall them.
